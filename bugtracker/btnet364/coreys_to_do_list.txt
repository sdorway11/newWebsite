I have a similar issue with the decoding of this function, which is used as follows :
subject = SharpMimeTools.parserfc2047Header(mime_message.Header.Subject);

Hereunder a some mail titles --> and the deconding given by the function :
Normal test --> Normal test
RE: TEST é hello --> RE: TEST é hello
RE: TE[ST é hello --> =?iso-8859-1?Q?RE:TE[ST=E9_hello?=
RE: [TEST é hello --> =?iso-8859-1?Q?RE:[TEST=E9_hello?=
RE: TE{ST é hello --> RE: TE{ST é hello
RE: TE[ST hello --> RE: TE[ST hello
RE: TE+ST é hello --> RE: TE+ST é hello

It seems like the combinaison of accent and braquet is causing the mess.
I have tested with the lastest available SharpMime version 0.6.beta).




Testing sourceforge ssn+ssh....

An email was added via project POP3. Click "reply all" on email comment in bug. All entries from to or cc which contains the sending adress are skipped.

Affected file: send_email.aspx
Affected version: 3.6.1

Old code:
if (lines[i].StartsWith("To:") || lines[i].StartsWith("Cc:"))
{
string cc_addr = lines[i].Substring(3, lines[i].Length - 3).Trim();

// don't cc yourself

if (cc_addr.IndexOf(from.SelectedItem.Value) == -1)
{
    if (cc_addrs != "")
    {
        cc_addrs += ",";
    }

    cc_addrs += cc_addr;
}

}

Possible solution, replacing above:
if (lines[i].StartsWith("To:") || lines[i].StartsWith("Cc:"))
{
string[] cc_addr = lines[i].Substring(3, lines[i].Length - 3).Trim().Split(',');

foreach (string a in cc_addr)
{
    // don't cc yourself
    if (!a.Contains(from.SelectedItem.Value) && !a.Contains(to.Value))
    {
        if (cc_addrs != "")
        {
            cc_addrs += ",";
        }

        cc_addrs += a.Trim();
    }
}

}

My bugtracker track the mail box of tartempion@xxxx.zz and someone send an email with - to recipient 
: gilles@sss.cc - cc recipient : tartempion@xxxx.zz I check the bug_posts table and i see 
tartempion@xxxx.zz in the field bp_email_cc but the field bp_email_to is empty... Is there a way 
to have the field bp_email_to with the value gilles@sss.cc ?

	My co-workers are not using the $SEEN flag because it does not reset when
	the bug has changed.

	Is it possible to reset all the $SEEN flags to NotSeen if a bug has
	changed, and the flag is currently off?

	My co-workers would rather see all the items that have changed since they
	last viewed, than see what is newly entering the system.

	There could be better solutions than what I have proposed.
	Example:
	One color would be for Never Seen
	Second Color would be for Seen But Changed
	Third color would be Seen and not changed

	Also, having the $SEEN flag automatically change to "Seen and Not changed"
	upon viewing of a bug would be a nice feature.

Is there a way to default which email address is used when sending an email from a bug? Often when sending an email I forget to send it as from the project address and it's sent out from my own. The problem with this is that the reply doesn't go back into the bug, but into my personal email.


*	This is what is happening, for us anyway. We have a small handful of people that are assisting with support calls. They are each on a different shift, answering bugs for users that are also on different shifts. Support person A (works 7a-3a), might respond via BTNet email to User C (works 11P-7a) request for assistance.

	User C responds back with additional information to the email from Support A (who is now off for 3 days), but it is delivered to his personal email, so BTNet is not updated and it can sit in that email for a long period of time with being viewed.

	Meanwhile Support Person B (works 3p-11p) sends another email because he doesn't see that the bug was updated yet. Again the reply from User C goes back to the Support B personal email and does not get updated in BTNet.

	What I was thinking was to see if we could just have a global option for a 'send all emails from' that will force the sending email address to be the support one that is used by the end users who submit their bugs via email. That way, when the end user replies back, it will go to the support mailbox, not the personal mailbox of the support personnel. BTNet can then accurately track and update the bugs with responses from the support people and the end user responses.

	Just a thought, but I think it would really make it a great tool for tracking the 24 hour support locations.

	Sorry, the above working hours for Support person A should be 7a - 3p.
