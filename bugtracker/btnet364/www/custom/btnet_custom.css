Use this, btnet_edit_bug.css and btnet_search.css to customize your look.
For the overall look, use this file to override what btnet_base.css says.

For position, use btnet_edit_bug.css and btnet_search.css are seperate so that if you want to change 
the positioning of elements, you can do so on those two pages independently, 
without changes in one breaking the other.

You can use css to display different priorities and statuses in different fonts, etc.
See the "demo use of css classes" query.
