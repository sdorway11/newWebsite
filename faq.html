                <p>The short answer: since 2012.</p>
                <p>Erik (Co-Founder of The Tech Academy) has been training developers for over ten years. In 2012, he decided to launch his own programming boot camp under the name "Prosper I.T. Academy". The program has been running since then.</p>
                <p>At the end of 2013, Erik brought on Jack Stanley. They spent months on curriculum development and in early 2014, re-branded as The Tech Academy because based on suryeys done, The Tech Academy was a better name.</p>

                <p>Our program is self-paced. We are open weekdays, weeknights and weekends. We recommend students study a minimum of 40 hours a week at our school because this best guarantees they will complete their training within the normal time period. But, 40 hours a week is not required. We are flexible. Some students work full-time concurrently to taking our program, so they work on our program part-time; maybe 20 hours a week.

                <p>Our program is a balance of theory study and practical experience. Throughout the Boot Camp, you will be assigned paired coding projects
occasionally. So the answer is: yes, sometimes you will be paired and sometimes you will work solo - just like the real world.</p>

                <p>1. There are Job Placement Directors at The Tech Academy whose sole job is to assist students and graduates in their job search.<br />
                    2. The final course of the Software Developer Boot Camp is the Job Placement Course. This course teaches people all they need to know to get
a job in technology.</p>
                <p>We work hard to ensure that every graduate lands a job.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, we can't get a job for students, so the 95% placement rate is really the product of persistence on the part of students and
graduates of our program.</p>
