                  <p>"With all of the information that I have learned in this course I can use it for a solid foundation. It provides the building blocks to understanding how a computer works on a core level. It will allow me to be more familiar with all the computer terminology that I wasn't very familiar with before. Through taking this course, it actually opened my eyes to the endless possibilities that are available in the software development field. Before I thought web or mobile would be the only places I would want to go, but I have actually grown a curiosity for even OS's or computer software. The course was great, it was nice and easy at the beginning and then went up the ramp in difficulty just right. I loved the challenges that it provided, and I can't wait for more!" <em>- Jeremiah S.</em></p>

                  <p>"I gained a great understanding of the WordPress platform’s robust feature sets and how to create some great sites using plugins.The step by step YouTube video on creating a WordPress website real encompassed a great overview of the WordPress platform and the possibilities of that site. I also learned knowing WordPress is beneficial because 25% of the websites use it as their platform. It is also a great site to develop for because it so user friendly for individuals with limited experience to be able to manage their sites. If I wanted to develop sites for small businesses, the ability for that business owner to manage both their site and their content requires a much lower learning curve than the traditional sites with extensive HTML and limited functionality. WordPress in short is the CMS for the average person. I am already using the tools I learned in this course. My running club has contracted a web developer firm to redesign and build our website using WordPress. The knowledge I learned helped me articulate to my club during one of recent meetings the ability that we can change and update the menus within WordPress, so we would not need to worry about the exact naming of the main level menus as we can change and modify as needed. I can use my knowledge and experience of WordPress to help develop, maintain and teach customers how to use the tools within the system to curate and manage their content." <em>- Michael A.</em></p>

                  <p>"I learned the importance of really understanding the basics so that we can think methodically when entering the real world, and even in the rest of this program. For me, I want to further my studying in flowcharting and algorithms so I can really master breaking things down into smaller pieces and have a good base and outline in regards to programming, or at least increased confidence and proficiency in the initial problems to be analyzed and solved. For me, I tend to have a minimal problem asking for help, so this video really encouraged me to ask for it when needed (after I actually try and research and problem solve on my own first). It was also helpful to hear that we do not need to know it all, but rather gain the skills to figure out solutions to problems that arise. This course helped to further drill in my brain a bit more in regards to data types and languages. I can use this information that I have gained in this program so far to remind myself the importance of the basic fundamentals in approaching tough problems that will inevitably arise. Problem solving is the name of the game, after all." <em>- Joy E.</em></p>

                  <p><strong>Here is one student success story from the HTML and CSS Course:</strong></p>
                  <p>"I am new to the "modern" programming languages of the internet, so HTML5 and CSS3 were really new for me at the start of the course. I knew some of the little conventions like inline tags for formatting fonts (like &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;), but everything else was 100% new for me. However, it was really simple to pick up. It feels like HTML is a very high level language, truly designed for the human programmer's ease of use and readability instead of the machine.
                      <br />
                      One of the big things that really struck me was how HTML and CSS work with the browsers. I never really put it together in my mind until now, but when we create a website by coding it into HTML and CSS, we are not really "programming" per se, but more like giving another program an organized list of instructions to perform on our behalf. While writing HTML code is very, very similar to writing a program, I am not actually writing an executable program. I am writing a "program" that is executed by another program (the browser) in order to achieve the results I am looking for. I find that a little fascinating.
                      <br />
                      I know I just talked about how coding HTML is not exactly programming, but that is the most enjoyable thing about the course for me: coding. Learning the syntax of the language and the different uses for each command was really fun. I did several of the exercises in the Murach text which were fun and interesting. It was just following a list of directions, but it gave me a chance to see, in my mind, how one would put these instructions together to achieve desired results. Textbook illustrations and exercises are so academic, but they do help one build upon just head knowledge. I imagine understanding how HTML5 and CSS3 work together and with internet browsers will be quite useful in the future, even if my specific responsibilities may not be in website creation/maintenance. More likely, I will need to read HTML code in order find "variable" names used to gather website user inputs in a form for me to then utilize in the creation of another program to process that data." <em>-Ryan S.</em></p>

                  <p>"Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment IDE) from Microsoft that provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for developers to create apps, programs, websites among many other things. It offers developers many programming languages to use including C# and Python. It helps developers write code efficiently through various features like intellisense which anticipates the possible code the developer might use as they type the first few letters and by offering a debugging feature that helps detect and eliminate code errors. As a developer, I imagine using Visual Studio in helping create web apps and web pages. It was good to get an introduction to the Visual Studio environment.

                <p>Keeping track of the various stages of a software program as it is created is vital, if only so that if you find that you’re taking the wrong approach to a programming task, you will want a way to get rid of the changes you made and go back to before you tried that approach. Version control allows this as well as other valuable actions related to managing the sometimes lengthy and complex process of making software. You will learn the various approaches to version control, and use it on your own projects. You'll learn:</p>

                  <p>"Version control is managing and tracking changes to a file. In the career of Software Development, It seems that it will be very rare to be working on one file, with only one person touching the file. So tracking the changes of code, managing who is editing and how to merge changes at the same time is critical. Overwriting someones changes or having yours, is the last thing anyone would want. The tools of Git, and other Version Control Systems cover this as well as other tools that help software developers, collaborate to work with each other such as being able to assign tasks and view bug fixes. It seems like all companies are using a version control system, I use one in manufacturing in fact. So you better get familiar with it!" <em>-Hank B.</em></p>

                  <p>"The JavaScript course demonstrates the powerful applications of JavaScript and jQuery in web design. As with all of the courses here, it started at a gradual pace that allowed ample time for me to grasp the concept of a new language before embarking upon coding my own JavaScript and jQuery scripts. Each practical embraced a different parameter of this diverse language and broke down the syntax in an easy to understand manner. As intimidating as JavaScript appears at first, I quickly found that it has many similarities to other languages. PHP, (the prerequisite course), for example, really helped to lay the foundation for a lofty amount of the syntax and functions that I encountered in JavaScript. As the course progressed, I felt more and more confident in my JavaScript skills. Even though there were many hours of trial and tribulation, the gratification that I felt when I found the errors in my code and was able to execute a function was empowering. After this course, and all those previous, my understanding and ability to read code has improved exponentially! JavaScript is definitely a powerful tool for every developer to have in their arsenal. Especially in our world of mobile technology and rampant inter-connectivity. The power of JavaScript and the jQuery library is one of the more impressive aspects of this program thus far. To be able to see the level of care and work that is put in by a community of passionate coders to help an already diverse language become more and more applicable across more and more platforms. This course really helped to illustrate the importance of web development languages within the already outstanding curriculum here." <em>- Cole D.</em></p>

                  <p>"Python is the first course that's designed to take place over a few weeks. It covers the basics, like variables, functions, and python's basic data structures, all the way up to GUIs and Database manipulation through SQlite. I really enjoyed this course, as someone that loves a programming challenge, this course introduced new concepts by giving students a challenge they may face in the real work place. At first, the script is simple. But each subsequent task requires that the student improve upon the previous script by introducing a new concept. First it's simple file manipulation, then that script is wrapped into a GUI, and finally the GUI is improved and updated with database functionality. By the end, you feel like you've worked on a product that could really be used in a work place on a day to day basis. All the while furthering your knowledge of python. Python is quickly growing into every sector of the LAMP stack these days, and it's a must know for developers planning to work on any area of software development. So being introduced to it in the way The Tech Academy goes about it was a real treat." <em>-Nick J.</em></p>

                  <p>"C# was far and away the most intensive course thus far in the program. If you weren't comfortable with programming yet, you certainly will be after taking this course. For me, I took away a solid foundation in C#. Not just syntactically, but in terms of how a C# program should be written. The course really shows you, and demonstrates to you, what exactly an interface is, what an abstract class is, how to use the system libraries, why abstraction is important, and mostly importantly, how to take these concepts and use them to create actual products. In addition to everything above, you'll get a crash course in delegates, lambda functions, ADO.NET and LINQ, how to integrate T-SQL code with your C#, how to handle entities using the Entity Framework, how to work with the various string and file libraries contained within the System libraries. It dives a bit into some basic data structures and algorithms, like queues, and stacks. as well as some basic sorts. All of which is incredibly applicable to the software world, and ultimately are the skills that employers want to see demonstrated to land you a job. The knowledge in this course has prepared me to apply every aspect of Microsoft's frameworks using C#." <em>-Nick J.</em></p>

                  <p>"Project Management and the Project Management Life Cycle are specific processes and steps for managing the many tasks, responsibilities, people, and moving parts from project launch to project completion. I think the biggest lessons were not to start a project until you have full agreement on the deliverables and methods for dealing with being behind schedule. The organization that I am interning with is using the Agile methodology, so I am already using that style now. We complete specific tasks in small phases and then turn information over to the client to review. I can see how beneficial it is to operate this way, because it is sometimes simpler to see how something will work rather than have someone explain to you. Interacting with the actual environment gives clients something to provide feedback on." <em>- Sara L.</em></p>

                  <p>"Participating in the Live Project was an invaluable learning experience. It has taught me what it’s really like to think and work like a software developer. This experience has helped me to gain a sense of what it may be like to work in a real live software development environment. In this Live Project, I had the opportunity to create raw code that is being used in an actual client’s website. My responsibility was to work with Handlebars.js, a compiler that takes any HTML and Handlebars expression and implements them to a JavaScript function. To be quite frank, I’m still a little unsure of how it completely works. But the important aspect that I drew from this experience is that before the Live Project, I’d never even heard of handlebars.js. But now I can create a webpage that utilizes handlebars.js to a certain degree. This may not seem like much to some with more experience, but to me this is paramount. 
                      <br />
                      My greatest computer skill before coming to the Tech Academy was my ability to turn on the computer, which at times I wasn’t very good at that either. I entered the Tech Academy with absolutely no prior computer coding experience. The advances I’ve made through the different courses and completing the Live Project, for me have been huge. I now possess a fundamental ground work of skills that I can use and apply to various aspects of computer programming/development. For that I am very grateful.
